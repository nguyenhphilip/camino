<p>After Belgium, I spent a night in Prague and took a bus to Hungary the next morning. I stayed there for 10 days with E, the Hungarian woman I had a crush on in the beginning of this whole adventure.</p>

<p>It felt strange, to be back in the swing of normalcy. As if such a thing was possible.</p>

<p>There was no bitterness or resentment toward M. Actually, I was alarmed at how fast I was “moving on”. It seemed as if my mind had compartmentalized the Camino experience, like it was all a dream I had just woken from.</p>

<p>While with E, it was like nothing had changed. We talked with the same depth and intensity as we had in Canada, and I seemed to be living and acting like a normal human being. The feelings I had for her were still there too, which surprised me. Was I already losing the Camino?</p>

<p>The fact that it was over didn&rsquo;t hit me until I was home in California on October 26th, 2017. A teary-eyed Mother was waiting for me in LAX. She said I looked like a tan monk. We went home. I hugged my Dad and brother. I shared brief stories of my experience, then went to bed.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I fell into a state of deep loneliness, despondence, and longing. My friends and parents tried to soothe my grievances, but they couldn&rsquo;t. I was falling into a hole that simply did not exist in their world. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re home now. Shouldn&rsquo;t you be happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few days later, it became clear to me that I was missing life on the road. But why? What was it that I missed? The simplicity? The friendships? The solitude? The clarity? A sense of purpose? Purpose.</p>

<p>I was doing it all wrong. I was trying too hard to return to a place in my mind that was concrete and grounded; trying too hard to refit my life into the straitjacket I had fought so hard to escape from. Purpose: I had searched the Camino for such a thing, but never found it. Only when I had abandoned my search and surrendered the idea that I could control each and every ounce of my life, did I finally understand what was worth living for: growth, and love. In some sense, these things are also a form of purpose. Perhaps that is the great paradox: we continually strive for meaning when nothing really matters in the grand scheme of things. Perhaps that is what keeps us going – we get to decide what matters and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Purpose is what keeps us afloat in our day to day, year to year existence until the moment we take our final breath. Here lies our greatest opportunity: we are both actor and director. We get to choose what is and isn&rsquo;t meaningful to us, what&rsquo;s worth and not worth fighting for. Although the grand stage is, in some ways, already set, we get to decide how we want to play the game.</p>

<p>I suppose I wasn&rsquo;t ready to decide yet, and I had to be fine with that. I had to be fine with sitting in the unknown, as terrifying as it may be. Perhaps more terrifying is latching onto a purpose not designed and chosen by you.</p>

<p>The world around me had not changed. It was I who had become displaced, dislodged, different. I felt it in the way I perceived things, in the way I talked with my friends, in the way I thought about time. I could feel it in the growing distance between who I thought I was, and who I always have been. Only when I accepted it, that I had been fundamentally changed, did I begin to find Home again.</p>

<p>Home wasn&rsquo;t ever about a place or its inhabitants. Home begins and grows from the inner wellspring of one&rsquo;s being. In a sense then, home truly is where the heart is. Home is a space we create.</p>

<p>I am reminded of a quote by Joanna Field:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I did not know that I could only get the most out of life by giving myself up to it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That feeling I had in Santiago –– of wholeness, interconnectedness, fluidity, shapelessness, of being something outside of myself –– it didn&rsquo;t last long, but something in me had shifted.</p>

<p>The world feels more beautiful. Perspective is easier to hold and maintain. The everyday is less mundane and more majestic. Little things don&rsquo;t bother me as much. Peace and contentment are more accessible.</p>

<p>Of course, I will still have my bad days and mood swings. I will still have my moments of doubt and paralysis within the darker depths of my mind, moments when I am unable to see the light gleaming over the horizon.</p>

<p>But I know now it is always possible to get out, to surrender, to let go and be still, to feel what I feel without attachment, to be impermanent, to be.</p>

<p>This moment. This beautiful, precious, seamless moment. This is it.</p>
