        <p>I woke to the sound of creaking bunk beds, rustling backpacks, and clanking poles. 5:30 a.m. <em>Time to go.</em> I put my boots on, packed my sleeping bag, and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Small talk of good weather and stellar walking conditions. Free bread was served, though it was as stiff as stones. Luckily we were also provided with butter and peach marmalade. I devour as much of the bread as my mouth could muster and went on my way.</p>

<p>It was dark, cold, and misty out. I had heard the first day was arduous: 27.4 kilometers from Saint-Jean to Roncesvalles, with a gradual gain of 1400 meters in elevation.</p>

<p>I equipped myself with a smile, shouldered my rucksack, and began to walk.</p>

<p>For most of the morning, I walked along a narrow road populated by small farms and modest homes. A constant stream of white vans drove by, presumably transporting those daunted by the unavoidable ascent over the Pyrenees, or those who were physically incapable. The air stank of manure and wheat, though I felt invigorated by a sense of new beginnings.</p>

<p>After 5-6 kilometers of walking in twilight, I reached the base of the Pyrenees. I allowed myself a short break, then began my ascent. As I climbed higher into the sky, the sun rose to fulfill its daily task. Clumps of green became discernible blades of grass, darkness turned to shadow, cowbells and birdsong filled the air. The landscape was awakening.</p>

<p>There were many walkers, and I was amazed by the sheer variety––young and old; American and Canadian, English and Irish; German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish; Korean, Japanese… the list is endless.</p>

<p>It was easy to discern those who were simply on vacation from those who were in search of meaning. The vacationers were often the couples or groups. Conversations were light; suffering was avoided or mitigated; they lacked a spiritual connection to the Camino. Conversely, the seekers walked alone. They connected with other soloists and seekers, suffering was meaningful, the Camino had called to them.</p>

<p>Of course, these are only superficial observations. A person could be walking for deeply personal reasons, but had decided to go with others because they were simply terrified of walking alone. And certainly there were those who behaved like spiritual hound dogs on a life-or-death mission. They often lost sight of the very thing they were seeking––it was usually right under their noses.</p>

<p>After two hours of scaling the Pyrenees, I arrived at Refuge Orisson, an albergue about 8 kilometers west of Saint-Jean. I took a break and bought myself another round of breakfast––espresso with a Spanish tortilla. The mountainous air was cool and refreshing, the views from the terrace stunning.</p>

<p>Back on the road, I was greeted by a cheery social worker from South Korea named San. He didn’t speak fluent English, but he always had positive things to say, and he laughed at my jokes––this was my favorite quality about him. I appreciated his lighthearted nature, and we got along just fine.</p>

<p>We met another South Korean named Jackie moments later. She had worked in the hospitality industry for a year before deciding that she was unsatisfied with her life. She was a seeker. Unlike San, her English was fluent. She understood my jokes but didn’t laugh at them the way San did. Regardless, we welcomed her company and walked together for the next two hours.</p>

<p>Solitude is a stolen moment in the early stages of the Camino. San and Jackie needed a break, so I continued on without them, knowing that we would meet again in Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>A continual stream of other pilgrims took their place. It was overwhelming at times, all the Buen Caminos and fleeting conversations. I appreciated the earnest attempts to connect, but I often simply wanted to be alone. That was something I was still trying to learn: to accept and be open to the unexpected.</p>

<p>I arrived at Roncesvalles in the afternoon. It’s a small town with two restaurant-bars, a hotel, and a gothic monastery that accommodates 200 or more pilgrims. After checking in, I idled in the courtyard, called my parents, and wrote in my journal. Later, Jackie and I got a drink at the bar to celebrate our first full day of walking.</p>

<p>We went to the nearby restaurant for dinner with some of the other pilgrims. The standard pilgrim meal consists of an appetizer, the main dish, and dessert. And of course, a bottle of red wine. Always.</p>

<p>Our tongues were loosened by the wine, we began to share stories of who we were, where we came from, and why we were walking the Camino.</p>

<p>The Spanish couple at our table had recently returned to Spain after having lived in London for several years, stating that life in the city was too complicated. They preferred the simple lifestyle of Spain, and they were walking the Camino to celebrate their homecoming. Another man from Italy shared that he had been walking every year for the past five years. He liked the perspective he gained and the people he met.</p>

<p>“Everyone has a story to share on the Camino. I come here to learn how to listen,” he said.</p>

<p>After dinner, I retreated to my bunk bed and journaled about the day.</p>

<p>Walking in unknown territory vitalized and nourished me. I felt strong and powerful, small and humbled beneath the Spanish skies. Perhaps I was here to write the rest of my own story; to rediscover and map the terrain of my heart.</p>

<p>I check the contents of my rucksack again. Three outfits and two pairs of socks. A sleeping bag and a down jacket. Phone charger, toiletries, another set of shoes in addition to my boots. Just in case.</p>

<p>Emergency medical supplies for three days. The KIND bars have been shared and devoured; my 1-liter nalgene bottle is filled to the brim. My California license plate––the only item of sentimental value. A journal and my writing tools.</p>

<p>Nervousness. I take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Excitement. I let it go, slowly.</p>

<p>They’re two sides of the same coin, and I am standing on the precipice.</p>
