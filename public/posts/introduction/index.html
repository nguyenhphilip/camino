<p>In May of 2017, while working in a Title I Elementary school in New Hampshire, I read a little fable called “Rebirth” by Kaval Ravikant.</p>

<p>The main character, Amit, is unable to return home after the death of his estranged father. He wanders, lost and filled with pain and grief, and is led to the Camino de Santiago. There, he meets many travelers and pilgrims. Some are lost and searching for answers, others are running from their past, but all have a story to share. Along the month-long journey, he is faced with the big questions of life, causing him to grow in a new direction and way of being.</p>

<p>Upon finishing the story, the seeds of the Camino were planted in my mind. I will walk the Camino one day. And perhaps by fate, just when I needed them to bloom, the seeds came to fruition 3 months later at a summer camp in Maine.</p>

<h2 id="summer-camp-maine">Summer Camp, Maine</h2>

<p>I had just finished my year of service with City Year, New Hampshire. The plan afterwards was to attend Boston University for a graduate program in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, but it didn’t feel like a good fit for me, so I deferred. With little time for decisions and no alternatives in sight, I took a job as a camp counselor in Maine.</p>

<p>During the second week of camp, I applied for a job in Colorado, quite confident of my ability to secure the position. Needless to say, I was met with rejection, and it was then clear to me that I had no direction in my life. I applied to a graduate program because it seemed like the proper step to take, and I applied to a random job in Colorado because I yearned for a sense of security. What was I truly willing to work for? What did I actually want to do with my life? How did I want to live? These questions haunted me, beckoning for resolution.</p>

<p>I turned to books for guidance––my usual coping strategy when stressed––and reread The Alchemist and When Breath Becomes Air. The Alchemist inspired a dreamy sense of possibility, while Breath instilled a demanding sense of urgency. But they resolved nothing. I needed concrete steps toward writing my own story.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, like a godsend, the idea of walking the Camino came to mind. The sensible me thought the idea was impulsive and irresponsible: what if I end up wasting my time? Was I only avoiding my problems? Was I simply running away from the demands of the world? Myself? Ultimately, my gut ignored these worries and made the decision for me: I went to the farmhouse (the only place with internet access at camp) and bought a one-way ticket to Europe.</p>

<p>A strange thing began to occur once my mind settled on the decision: life got better. Once I had finally committed to something – and conversely, had rejected the alternatives – I was able to get more out of life.Camp became fun, my relationships improved, my worries extinguished. I reveled in the interplay of Maine’s idyllic landscapes, the slow passage of time, and the high-pitched screams of happy campers.</p>

<p>There is a certain freedom that comes from commitment. Maybe if I had chosen to go to graduate school, I would have learned how to make the most of that too. But I felt no trace of regret for going to camp, and for committing to the Camino.</p>

<p>On one of our last nights off, some of the Hungarian staff and I decided to camp in Acadia National Park. We pitched our tents beneath an array of stars and pine silhouettes, lit a fire, and feasted on potato chips, beer, and wine. The smell of sizzling bacon and campfire permeated the air. I looked at my friends, then at the grand night sky. In that moment, it felt as if the universe was watching over me. I entrusted my future to it, I believed that things would work themselves out, I let go of my incessant need to control everything. In the warm arms of the sublime, I felt light, free, happy, and loved. I felt infinite.</p>

<h2 id="the-woods-of-maine">The Woods of Maine</h2>

<p>On the last day of camp, I paddled out to the middle of Echo Lake and sat amid the glossy water, wondering what to make of the whole experience, contemplating how the future would unfold.</p>

<p>It was my birthday –– August 10th. Not much has changed but me, I thought. I am the same person as I was yesterday, only now, I will walk around with the number 24 plastered to my identity. I was no longer 23, 15, or 10. And yet, in a way, I was: I was still the flippant adolescent of 14, the bashful child of 7, the confused adult of 18 to 23. How will I go about defining 24? If I&rsquo;m lucky, by adventure, courage, love, and maybe even commitment. I wrote a note to myself:</p>

<p>This life you have before you is the only certainty. Don’t take it for granted. Own it and live it with meaning, beauty, courage, grace, and presence. Dare to dream. Spend it with people you love, spend it loving people. Be heartbroken, be brave, make mistakes––do all the things that scare the shit out of you.</p>

<p>Once camp was over, I drove down to New Hampshire to see an old friend. We hiked Mount Washington –– I went barefoot –– and exchanged memories and stories in the backdrop of the White Mountains. Afterwards, I camped in the woods of Maine for five days while waiting for my friend E to finish her remaining days at camp. Then we were headed to Canada.</p>

<p>My days in the woods of Maine were long. In my prolonged state of solitude, I was able to view my inner demons with staggering clarity. Insecurity, self-doubt, fear, loneliness –– they vacated the forefront of my being. Only once I had learned to accept them as parts of me could I enjoy nature’s invitation to serenity.</p>

<p>Sitting on the crest of Seboeis Lake, I watched the clear water shimmer. I then began to feel a growing sense of interconnectedness with the world. My problems suddenly felt small, insignificant, and petty amid the grandeur, fading altogether as the water reposed and the sun descended. Silence ensued and the passage of time disappeared. My eyes began to swell. I then began to cry and laugh out of sheer euphoria. My audience, an ensemble of crickets, cicadas and other creatures, echoed in unison under the starry sky. I had been invited to witness a crescendo of grand proportions, and nature was the composer. My loneliness and sorrow was alleviated, and the words of Oliver Sacks ran through my mind: I was having intercourse with the world.</p>

<p>Moments like these were rare, though I&rsquo;ve noticed they are more likely to visit in solitude and conditions of stillness, and when one is confronting their demons. Should a person survive the trial by fire, she will come out more alive and deeply in-tune with the world around her. Her problems become grotesquely small. Her capacity for love and understanding and presence deepens. She becomes infinitely more capable. She is grateful for being invited back as a cast member in the grand play of the cosmos. There is no hesitation in cherishing the banquet of life.</p>

<h2 id="canada">Canada</h2>

<p>E and I met during Be a Camper Day, a day in which the counselors participate in the various programs throughout the camp, such as fishing or water-skiing. I led fishing in the Science Discovery Program, though the poles weren&rsquo;t ready yet, so we took the other counselors out on Echo Lake in canoes.</p>

<p>E happened to be in my canoe. She initially seemed hesitant to tag along because she either didn’t know how to swim, or she couldn’t swim very well. Regardless, in an attempt to ease her concerned look – and, yes, probably to impress – I assured her that I was a mighty-fine canoe-er, that she could trust me to take her on a voyage across the vast Echo Lake. In truth, it was my first time ever commanding a canoe, and luckily, it turned out to be a relatively easy task.</p>

<p>The summer air was pristine, the glassy lake gleamed in the sunlight, loon calls echoed in the distance. It was a perfect afternoon. I took notice of E’s dark, round eyes, of her rough European accent, of her curious necklace with a dragon hanging from it. She was from Hungary and worked in the Chef Camp program, and she liked Game of Thrones. We talked about nature and our impact as humans on it, what life at camp was like, our lives outside of camp, and U.S. consumerism, among other things.</p>

<p>We didn’t get the chance to see each other again until two weeks later. Camp kept us busy, I on the lake and she in Chef Camp. A few days after deciding to walk the Camino, she posted on the camp Facebook page that she was looking for people to go to Canada with.</p>

<p>At that point, I had developed a huge crush on her, which, to me, seemed terribly irrational because I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. Her home was in Hungary, English wasn’t her native language, and I had no clue as to what I would be doing for the rest of the year. The only outcome would be pain and unrequited love. Nevertheless, the feelings were there, and I wanted learn more about her. What did I have to lose? At the very least, the trip would be fun. So I replied to her post.</p>

<p>Later, we met and talked about the trip. We considered flying there, but that meant I would have to find a place to store my car – more unnecessary expenditures. So I offered to drive instead. She looked at me with excited, and perhaps bewildered eyes, and said, in her rough, alluring Hungarian accent, “We’re going to fucking Canada!”</p>

<p>In two days we drove from Maine to Quebec City, from Quebec City to Montreal, and from Montreal to Niagara Falls, with detours to Ottawa and Cobourg in-between. During that time, our friendship grew through a jumble of stupid jokes and cringy puns, camper stories, and metal music. She taught me Hungarian curse words and I taught her American slang: brooo, suhp duuude, liike, y’know.</p>

<p>But what really brought us close was vulnerability: we were open, honest, and non-judgmental in sharing each other’s past, in exchanging our deepest fears and darkest worries. The things we told each other were things that could destroy a person, things that most people bury and hide for eternity. And yet there we were, attempting to piece together the broken shards of our pasts.</p>

<p>In those moments, I wanted to pull her close, wrap her in my arms, and say that everything would be fine–that everything was fine, at least for the moment; that even if I do not fully understand her, I would always be there; that we, with our powers combined, could get through anything; that she was with me, the overly optimistic, hopelessly romantic, Phil.</p>

<p>We parted ways at Toronto Pearson International Airport, she to Mexico, and I to Ohio. It was a bittersweet goodbye–bitter because I have never been good at letting go, despite all of the practice I&rsquo;ve had; sweet in having shared the journey with such a wonderful person.</p>

<p>But she said it wasn’t goodbye, it was a see you later.</p>

<h2 id="departure-to-the-camino-september-5th">Departure to the Camino: September 5th</h2>

<p>I woke up in Boston on the cold, wooden floor of my friend’s apartment. It was his first day of graduate school, and my last in the U.S.</p>

<p>The only possessions I had were my 30L backpack, three sets of outfits, two books, a sleeping bag, my down jacket, a phone charger, toiletries, my boots, and a 12-pack of granola bars. My pack weighed no more than 10 lbs. The only thing left to prepare was my mind. I was jittery, nervous, and excited.</p>

<p>I spent most of the morning in a coffee shop writing a letter to my friends:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My life on the move is far from over: tonight, I will fly to Europe to begin my journey on the Camino de Santiago, a 500 mile trek across Northern Spain. It will take me 33-35 days to complete. And while I intend to do it alone, it will not be a solitary experience; I expect to meet and travel with people of all ages and walks of life on the road to Santiago. The Camino is one of my lifelong goals, and the opportunity to do it could be no more prime than now.</p>

<p>My motivations are simple: I want to see the world. I want to grow. I want to do something that scares the shit out of me.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of dreams, dreamers are met with several challenges. In my case, it was always figuring out what my next step was, dealing with the incessant self-doubt and fear that accompanies the process, and letting go of the attachments I developed with people, comfort, and calcified ideas that no longer served me. Such is the nature of walking the less trodden path. It’s unpaved, rocky, and dissuasive. If you don’t watch your step, you might just slip.</p>

<p>Yet “[taking] the [road] less traveled by, / that has made all the difference”, the difference being a profound learning experience, a life lived on your own terms, a dream turned concrete reality.</p>

<p>That, in a nutshell, is where I am going. You’ll know when I have made it across. Thanks for the love and support.</p>

<p>With Sincerity and Gratitude,</p>

<p>Your friendly neighbor, Phil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After posting the update, I thought of my parents and the argument we had a few days prior about my decision to walk the Camino. They believed I was being reckless, that I should’ve taken the guaranteed opportunity at Boston University; that I, at the age of 24, should have my life figured out. I felt like a disappointment, a terrible son. But this was the path I wanted to walk, and I needed to express my grievances. I needed them to understand who their son was.</p>

<p>Journal Entry - 8/29/17</p>

<p>Sorry I am not expectation or desire
Sorry I am not who you want me to be.
But I am not sorry for being me
for walking my own path.</p>

<p>Journal Entry - 8/30/17</p>

<p>About the world, about my place
Within this infinite space,
I sit at the margin, misunderstood.</p>

<p>We collide and tear each other apart
What ever happened to our graceful start?
I a child, you
unconditional.</p>

<p>I don’t want understanding–I want love.
Forgive me and my trespasses
As I learn to forgive myself
and to love you.</p>

<p>I wrote them a letter expressing how I truly felt. I sent it some minutes before boarding my plane to Europe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p>

<p>For the past twenty or so years, you have given me the best gift a child can ask for: your unconditional love. Despite our conflicts, despite our differences, despite the ever-growing physical distance between us, you have loved and supported me unflinchingly. Thank you for that.</p>

<p>The worlds you and I grew up in could be no more different. I was born and raised in the safe and sunny suburbs of California; you in the dangerous aftermath of the Vietnam war. My childhood consisted of friendships, books, and video games; yours of rice fields, conflict, and uncertainty. Where I see possibility, you see risk. I struggle to know what’s next, who I will become; you struggle to survive.</p>

<p>I understand why you might feel the way you do about the path I currently walk–certainly scared, frustrated, saddened, uncomfortable, and maybe disappointed. But know that you have raised a son who is strong, kind, independent, adventurous, curious, passionate, and happy. You have raised someone who isn&rsquo;t afraid to chase after what he wants, after what he dreams of. Most importantly, you have taught me the meaning of compassion and kindness; that it isn&rsquo;t always what we say that is important, but what we do instead.</p>

<p>If you ever meet the people I&rsquo;ve had the fortune of developing relationships with, I think they would say I am an easygoing, thoughtful, caring, friendly, loyal, and loving person; that I would give them the shirt off of my back and the food on my table to make them feel loved and welcomed. I only have you two to thank for this. You have taught me to be a person of good character; you have given me the basic necessities for leading a fulfilled and meaningful life.</p>

<p>Now at 24, as I step out into the world and begin to draw my own map of it, I need your love more than ever. Because I will stumble and fall; I will get hurt and be heartbroken; I will be sad and frustrated and challenged beyond anything I have yet to face in my short life. But what&rsquo;s life worth anyways if I don&rsquo;t risk getting scratched and bruised along the way? That&rsquo;s just a part of growing up; that’s how I have grown up; that&rsquo;s how I want to grow up.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re scared I won&rsquo;t continue my &ldquo;education&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t worry: my education has never been limited to the confines of a classroom. Life itself is the greatest teacher, and I am taught something new everyday.</p>

<p>If you worry I am a loose-cannon with no bearings or a home: Home has never been about a location or house. Home is where you feel at home, and for me, that is when I am growing. I am currently expanding the home of my heart.</p>

<p>I will not change. Whatever it is that drives me forward will continue to do so. That&rsquo;s not to say this force is inflexible or incapable of change, but rather that I will not deviate from who I am and who I will become. All I ask is for your continued love and acceptance of me. All of me. Not of who you wish me to be, but of who I already am.</p>

<p>I ask of myself to do the same. To accept and love you as you are and who you will become throughout time and eternity. I am endlessly grateful.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Your Son</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sending it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I was petrified &ndash; what would they say? Would they even understand? We weren’t a family that expressed our feelings so openly like this. It was always about the basics &ndash; food, water, money, school, family. Talking back –- which included expressing your opinions –- was not tolerated. You simply had to sit and listen.</p>

<p>I hated it. I hated being lectured at. Often my Dad would say, “Do you understand what I am saying? Or are the words flying out of the other ear?” Yeah Dad, sometimes they did; often times they did.</p>

<p>Before boarding, my Mom left me with this message:</p>

<p>“Philip, remember you will always be our son. I know you’re independent and want to do what you want, but always remember that. Me and your Dad will always support you, but know that I don’t feel happy about what you’re doing. I don’t feel good. I’m scared. Please stay safe. Keep us updated and send pictures. Your Dad and I love you.”</p>

<p>Heartbroken? Swelling with love? Check and check.</p>

<p>Are we ever truly ready for the future? I don’t think so. But that shouldn’t deter us from it. We will –- we must -– continue to march on into the darkness of the unknown light. Life is uncertain. Whether or not you have fun in the process, that is a choice, and I have chosen to dance.</p>

<p>I boarded the plane, unsure of what was to come. In the air, I took one last look at the Boston skyline. Clouds pressed against the horizon. A brilliant swath of pinkish-orange hues left the sky ablaze.</p>

<p>Behind me stood home. Ahead, answers amid a foreign landscape.</p>
