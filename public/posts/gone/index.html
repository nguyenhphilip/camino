<p>I have sunken into the depths of an all-too-familiar melancholy.</p>

<p>She is gone. I am alone. My emotions are swinging to the erratic cadence of an unforgiving grandfather clock.</p>

<p><center>
I’m fine.
I’m fine.
I’m fine.
I’m not.
</center></p>

<p>I miss the jade of her eyes, those luminescent opals I so often lose myself in. The ease of her smile, it was always able to bring about my own. The way she plucked those juicy blackberries from their thorny brambles, always a tad out of reach, the hem of her shirt lifting ever so slightly in the process, revealing the contours of a titillating landscape I secretly wished to explore.</p>

<p>I miss her laugh, her presence, the way she made me feel: Whole. Complete. Loved. I miss my Camino soulmate.</p>

<p>Absence: the presence of nothing. A palpable emptiness. A space in which nothing exists. A torturous paradox that gnaws away the seams of my mind.</p>

<p>A universe without incandescence.</p>

<h2 id="center-center"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>S has decided to stay another night in Burgos. Strange. He’s not taking the leave well.</p>

<p>I have to go. I have to walk.</p>

<p>The sky reflects my mood – gray, somber, displaced. I’m walking through a park between a row of trees. A runner waves at me and says, “Buen Camino!” I force a smile and wave back.</p>

<p>I’m lost – the hostel we stayed at was located somewhere deep within the city, far from the familiar path of the Camino. I need to find a yellow arrow.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Google Maps is able to lead me back on track. I spot a yellow arrow on a blue signpost pointing towards a stone bridge. A group of Spanish schoolchildren are crossing. I follow. They turn and smile at me. Un peregrino! I grin. What I would do to be a child right now: they get over things so quickly.</p>

<p>The past 15 days I have walked with another. Now she’s gone.</p>

<p>A remnant of what was, a reminder of what isn’t.</p>

<p>I walk.</p>

<h2 id="center-center-1"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>At the western edge of Burgos, I noticed an older man trailing me from a few meters behind. Some minutes later, he appeared at my shoulder, decelerated, and matched my pace.</p>

<p>“Ah, hello. You are young.”</p>

<p>“No I’m Phil.” He didn’t get the joke.</p>

<p>He would not let me mope alone &ndash; we walked together for the next 2 hours. He was a Korean Catholic priest on sabbatical. We talked about religion, the Camino, life. It was refreshing to hear another voice, to have a moment of mental relief. He noticed the concern on my face and asked why I was walking.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure anymore. I guess I was looking for a purpose, but I don&rsquo;t even know if I believe in such a big thing. But I feel like I have been going through life on a path that is not my own. Also, my best friend just left. We walked together for the past 2 weeks, and now she’s gone.”</p>

<p>That must be hard&hellip; let me ask you something: What are the most important things in your life?</p>

<p>“&hellip;I&hellip; I don’t know.” I felt ashamed for not knowing, but he reassured me:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. Most people have answers right away. But they haven’t thought about why; Why are those things important? It&rsquo;s ok not to know.</p>

<p>What makes you excited and happy?</p>

<p>“Well… right now, walking. I am enjoying my conversation with you. I like to learn. I like to travel and meet people. Anything that makes me feel alive.”</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>“I see where you’re going with this.”</p>

<p>It’s ok not to know. You don’t have to know where you’re going, you just need to keep going. And as long as you ask Why, you will go where you need to be. You might be searching for a clear answer, but it’s ok if you don’t find one by the end of your journey. Just keep asking Why, and be open to whatever it is that comes.</p>

<p>As a child, I had the calling to become a priest. But I decided to go to university to study architecture. I designed buildings for almost 15 years. I thought it was what I wanted. But something inside me kept saying it wasn’t. That was my heart speaking. It still said I had to become a priest. Finally, I listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don’t have a calling.”</p>

<p>But you do. Callings! You just need to listen. Listen to your heart. We went on like this for awhile.</p>

<p>Can we take a picture together?</p>

<p>He took out his phone and snapped a selfie of us.</p>

<p>I will always remember you.</p>

<p>He laughed, quickened his pace, and walked into the distance.</p>

<p>I never saw him again.</p>

<h2 id="center-center-2"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>After 34 kilometers, I arrived in Hontanas. I checked-in, unpacked, showered, and made dinner – pasta, tomatoes, and garbanzo beans. Afterwards, I walked aimlessly around town for a bit, then went into the church and sat in silence. I thought praying would help to fill the void, but it didn’t.</p>

<p>I left and clambered up a narrow flight of stairs behind my albergue. At the top was a swing-set and what looked like an abandoned bar. I continued to climb the hill until the people below looked like nothing more than ants. Barren hilltops and stretched clouds were pressed against the landscape. The sun was beginning its descent into the earth.</p>

<p>Why do I feel this way? I thought I had let her go. I thought I had accepted what was. Yesterday I was fine, today I&rsquo;m not. What happened? Is this what it feels like to let go of something, someone you love? Do I though? Do I love her?</p>

<p>I begin to vocalize my thoughts by talking to the sky, as if someone were listening to my grievances.</p>

<p>I accept it. Yes, I miss her. Maybe I do love her. I don’t know. What is love anyways? It’s so cliche. Boy meets girl in Spain. Falls in love. She flies away. and he lies to himself, tells himself he’s ok. He’s not. I miss her.</p>

<p>A weight begin to lift as I shout. I laugh and imagine M at my side, laughing with me, telling me how crazy of a person I am for talking to myself, shouting at nothing but the sun and clouds. But I knew she would understand.</p>

<p>A latch is released. Gratitude, clarity, stillness, tears.</p>

<p>The sky is poppy red, M’s favorite flower and color, a deep and radiant crimson.</p>
