<p><em>Pedrouzo, Spain.</em></p>

<p>In 20 kilometers, I will reach Santiago de Compostela. The anticipation has left me dreamless. Ali and Karen are fast asleep. Hope to see them again soon. I pack my things and make a quiet exit.</p>

<p>It’s dark out. Cars lie dormant under the hazy hue of flickering streetlights. Shop-signs strobe with a familiar fluorescence. I’m on the corner of a three-way intersection, eating a bun Karen had given me the night before. A wiry cat pokes its nose around, perhaps searching for food. Not too far ahead, I hear the rhythmic clacking of walking-poles. I finish my bun and proceed into the twilight, guided by nothing more than a yellow arrow.</p>

<h2 id="center-center-1"><center> &hellip; </center></h2>

<p>Neurons fire, muscles tense. One leg initiates, the other balances. Knee propels forward, heel touches ground. A weight shifts from posterior end to anterior front. Heel lifts, toes tip, a leg swings. One step. Repeat.</p>

<p>I have suffered. I have felt pain. But I have grown. I have become stronger. I am no longer under the illusion that life is best lived in pasts, shoulds, and futures. This is it. The people. The weather. The circumstances. Dusted boots. Rucksacks. A sunflower. Cobalt skies. Birdsong. Valleys. One leg in front of the other. Trotting. Sauntering. Walking.</p>

<p>Purpose may give direction to the journey, but it is our immediate presence that gives it meaning.</p>

<p>Santiago awaits.</p>

<h2 id="center-center-2"><center> &hellip; </center></h2>

<p>A strange thing happened. 10 kilometers from Santiago, while walking along a sidewalk, I was either hallucinating or vividly imagining the presence of every person I had met on the Camino. Matilde and Franca were tiptoeing across the fence to my left, as if on a tightrope. Closer to me was S, Jim, and Kathy. M was to my right. Everyone else was behind me, walking in silence. I have walked in solitude, but I have never been alone. The people, they have filled my heart. They have shown me the Way.</p>

<p><em>Santiago</em></p>

<p>I reached Santiago de Compostela on October 8th of 2017, a Sunday. I was in a dreamy state of mind, not at all aware of time, unsure of what to expect upon reaching the cathedral. I sifted through crowds of tourists and pilgrims, between narrow streets and alleyways, guided by a yellow arrow. The sound of bagpipes and commotion filled the air. Something smelled delicious. Anticipation coursed through my veins.</p>

<p>When I got to the cathedral, I felt rather confused. Was this it?</p>

<p><img src="/../images/santiago2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I walked to the center of the plaza, dismounted my rucksack, and sat for awhile. I looked at the faces surrounding me, searching for a sign. I did not feel a single thing.</p>

<p>I shifted my gaze to a man looking at me. We stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity. The look in his eyes spoke to me: Yes, you are here. Yes, you have made it.</p>

<p>I then began to cry. Peace and stillness, awe and gratitude, love and surrender; I was filled by the energy of raw, unfiltered emotion. The boundary between the world and I dissipated. I felt interconnected, whole, complete. I was no longer just Phil. I was a fluid, living, impermeable being that simply lived behind a mask called Phil.</p>

<p>The people around me suddenly became more than just people. They were human beings with families, friends, and feelings of their own; they each had their own unique stories, lives they’ve lived and will continue to live. Their eyes emitted a beautiful, radiating light, a light I can only describe as the light of Being, a light that said:</p>

<p>“I am human. I too feel love, pain, suffering, joy, curiosity, wonder. I am you. You are me. A perfect bundle of imperfections. And we are here, together, on a journey across Spain, across life, living a shared existence on a tiny blue mote called Earth amid a less tiny, wildly unknown universe. This is it. Existence. Being. Love.”</p>

<p>The man approached me in tears, and we embraced each other.</p>

<p>I made it.</p>

<p>Santiago de Compostela is the official endpoint of the Camino, though some pilgrims decide to walk the extra 90 or so kilometers to Finisterre, a coastal city at the edge of Spain, the end of the world. I had intended to end my journey there, but something convinced me otherwise.</p>

<p>I walked for 20 kilometers before feeling that something was off. It just didn’t feel the same. My sense of purpose was gone. Why had I decided to continue in the first place? I have always known how to persevere, how to press on, how to move forward – it had carried me through the pain, to Santiago. But something was telling me, the journey needs to end in Santiago. So I walked to the next town and took a bus back to Santiago. In the past, I would have felt a pang of regret, a bruising of the ego, for not muscling through to the end. But I did not feel any regret or a longing for more. I was content. I had had enough.</p>

<p>It was one of the best decisions I made on the Camino. Over the next 4 days, I was able to say goodbye to all of the significant people I had met:</p>

<p><img src="/../images/santiago4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ali and Karen (the brother and sister I met on my second to last day). They “adopted” me, and I really bonded with Ali. He felt like a long-lost older brother.</p>

<p><img src="/../images/santiago5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jim and Kathy (nearly cried after seeing them. It had been at least 1.5 weeks since we had last seen each other. They were my first friends. Kathy said, “The journey is coming full-circle.&rdquo; Indeed, it was.)</p>

<p>And of course, me and my favorite Germans: Franca and Matilde. I ran into them right after running into Jim and Kathy.</p>

<p>Karaoke!</p>

<p>The journey would not have been the same without them and the many others with whom I do not have pictures with.</p>

<p>But there was still one story left to close: M.</p>
