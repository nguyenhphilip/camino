<p>“Phil! I have a genius idea. You’re really going to like it.”</p>

<p>On the 12th day, M, S, and I went to the top of a hill to catch the sunset. We sifted through an amber field of dry grass and settled ourselves in a small circular clearing. The sky was cloudless, a cool breeze was present. We talked for awhile, about what I can’t remember, but I felt wonderfully alive. When the sun began its descent into the horizon, we were overcome by the silence of awe. With each passing minute, the birds seemed to be chirping louder and louder, almost as if they were calling to their friends, “Come! The miracle is happening again!” Then their voices were gone. Layer by layer, the orange and pinkish hues faded into the dark absolute of space and night as the stars took their place against the blackened sky.</p>

<p>“Hey M, can I share something with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>I wrapped my arm around her and pulled her close.</p>

<p>“Body heat.”</p>

<p>She pressed her body into mine.</p>

<p>“You are so incredibly lame.”</p>

<h2 id="center-center"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>M was always able to find the joy in every moment. Each and every time we walked by a blackberry bush, she would stop and eat a few. With eyes closed and a perked body, each bite was clearly a delectable gift from the Camino. And when we had coffee or tortillas, she would always exclaim, “This is the best coffee / tortilla I’ve ever tasted!”</p>

<p>I asked her what her secret was to enjoying life, and she laughed. “Oh it’s so simple, Phil, you just feel it. It is not something you can do with the mind, it is something you must feel with your heart.”</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s not helpful,&rdquo; I jabbed.</p>

<p>That night, while beneath a blanket of stars, she told us a story.</p>

<p>About 3 years ago, she had nearly committed suicide. She was part of a rigorous doctorate program for engineering. She hated it, she didn’t belong. It just wasn’t for her. And yet, she tried to claw her way through. To cope with the stress, she stopped eating for days at a time – it got her mind off engineering. After months of this, her body could no longer handle the stress and starvation.</p>

<p>In the hospital, she told her family that she wanted to and would walk the Camino (this would be her first one of three; we were walking on her third). Everyone said she was crazy to even think of such an idea in her current physical and mental state. But she ignored them and flew to Spain. A greater force was beckoning: the need to save herself. No one else would do it. No one but her.</p>

<p>With each passing day and every fallen footstep, she grew emotionally, physically, and mentally stronger. She allowed lightness, joy, and gratitude to fill her soul. Food tasted good again, indescribably good &ndash; at times, while eating, she was brought to tears.</p>

<p>I then understood why every tortilla, coffee, and blackberry were the best in the world to her: life and its constitutes had become an indispensable gift; the best days were the ones in which she was alive and well enough to experiencing it. Does it take such a close encounter to death to realize the beauty of what is right under our noses?</p>

<p>When she reached Santiago, she fell to her knees and cried. She had proved her family wrong. She had made it. She had found a reason to live.</p>

<h2 id="center-center-1"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>I read her &ldquo;The Journey&rdquo; by Mary Oliver after she finished telling me her story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One day you finally knew<br>
what you had to do, and began,<br>
though the voices around you<br>
kept shouting<br>
their bad advice–<br>
though the whole house<br>
began to tremble<br>
and you felt the old tug<br>
at your ankles.<br>
&ldquo;Mend my life!&rdquo;<br>
each voice cried.<br>
But you didn&rsquo;t stop.<br>
You knew what you had to do,<br>
though the wind pried<br>
with its stiff fingers<br>
at the very foundations,<br>
though their melancholy<br>
was terrible.<br>
It was already late<br>
enough, and a wild night,<br>
and the road full of fallen<br>
branches and stones.<br>
But little by little,<br>
as you left their voices behind,<br>
the stars began to burn<br>
through the sheets of clouds,<br>
and there was a new voice<br>
which you slowly<br>
recognized as your own,<br>
that kept you company<br>
as you strode deeper and deeper<br>
into the world,<br>
determined to do<br>
the only thing you could do&ndash;<br>
determined to save<br>
the only life you could save.<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No words could express the gratitude I felt at that moment. I was thankful that she was alive and in my arms on a cold field somewhere in Spain. S eventually caved and accepted our invitation to share body heat under the cool night sky.</p>

<p>“Why did the universe bring us all together?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don&rsquo;t know, but I believe that everything happens for a reason,&rdquo; said M.</p>
