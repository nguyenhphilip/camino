        <p>The Camino de Santiago is a network of pilgrimage routes that lead to the city of Santiago de Compostela in Northwestern Spain, where the Saint James is rumored to be buried. The most popular route is the Camino Frances. It begins at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in Southern France, a small city located north of the Pyrenees, and totals about 500 miles across to Santiago de Compostela. Many walk for spiritual and religious reasons; I walk in search of myself.</p>

<p>The first challenge of the Camino is to actually get on the Camino. Since my starting point was at Saint-Jean, I needed to take a flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport to Biarritz––a small city in Southwestern France––and from Biarritz a bus to the nearby city, Bayonne, and from Bayonne another bus to Saint-Jean. I begin in Charles de Gaulle.</p>

<p>I met my first two friends and pilgrims while waiting in line to board the plane in Charles de Gaulle airport. I feel a tap on my shoulder and turn around to meet Jim and Kathy, a genial, retired couple from Truckee, California. They are walking because they believe that life is too short to be lived at the wayside; that retirement and age should enable one’s life, not inhibit it. Their sharp-blue eyes and warm smiles radiated with youth and sincerity.</p>

<p>Once we landed in Biarritz, we had to catch a bus to Bayonne. Jim and Kathy said it cost one euro to board. Unfortunately, I didn’t have any euros yet––a massive mistake on my part––and a currency exchange was nowhere to be found. I returned to the bus stop, and Jim seemed to notice my concerned expression. I told him I had no euros. He laughed in response and handed me one. I was taken aback by his casual generosity and thanked him. It seemed as if the Camino was conspiring to make my journey possible, as if I were integral to the writing of the Camino’s story. I looked at Jim and Kathy and smiled.</p>

<p>I made my second pair of friends, Franca and Matilde, the dynamic 18-year old Germans, while waiting in Bayonne for a bus to Saint-Jean. The friendship began with a simple request:</p>

<p>“Hallo there! Do you mind watching our stuff while we use the toilet?” Matilde asked.</p>

<p>“Yeah! Of course,” I reply. But toilet? Was that some form of European vernacular for bathroom? As it turns out, yes.</p>

<p>The bus arrived and we were on our way to Saint-Jean. I sat in the back of the bus where I had a panoramic view of the Pyrenees mountains. The sun-bathed ridges soared across the naked sky, reminding me of my many hikes in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The shadow of leaves formed, disappeared, and formed again in rapid oscillations on my left arm and leg, a simple dance of light that delighted my eye.</p>

<p>I directed my attention back into the bus and took notice of the numerous people before me. Matilde and Franca were near the front, sitting next to a tall, lanky Texan named Stefan. I then turned my gaze toward Jim and Cathy. Jim was resisting Cathy’s attempts to straddle him. He looked somewhat embarrassed, but I knew he was reveling in the moment. Their eyes and smiles spoke of a timeless love.</p>

<p>After an hour or so, we arrived in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, the official starting point of the Camino Frances. In the near distance stood the Pyrenees, the omnipotent guardians of the city, and on the other side was Spain.</p>

<p>Along the length of the Camino, there are hundreds of yellow arrows marked on tree stumps, signposts, and walls, with the sole purpose of leading you to Santiago de Compostela. As long as you were following the arrows, you were presumably going the right way. To trust the arrow then is the pilgrim’s first leap of faith on the Camino.</p>

<p>My first task upon arriving in Saint-Jean was to obtain a credencial. The credencial marked me as an official pilgrim. It was required to stay in the albergues––the pilgrim hostels––and, if you cared for it, for the certificate of completion in Santiago. I followed a trail of yellow arrows into Saint-Jean, found the Pilgrim’s Office, and received my badge of honor.</p>

<p>I had booked an albergue in advance for my first night, but it wasn&rsquo;t open yet, so I went to explore the town. The cobblestone roads were furnished by a myriad of markets, sandwich shops, charcuteries, restaurants and kiosks. Plastered on each of their fronts was the notorious scallop shell of the Camino. The shell represents the idea that all paths lead to Santiago, which struck me as a rich metaphor for life: wherever we are going, whatever path we are on, we are always lead to Truth, God, oneself. Maybe there is no wrong path in life, so long as we continue walking.</p>

<p>My albergue opened at 4 p.m. Inside, the other pilgrims and I were greeted by a man who could be characterized as the Yoda of the Camino. He was our hospitalero, the person in charge of running the albergue. Before checking us in, he sat us down and imparted his wisdom.</p>

<p>“When you wake up tomorrow,” he began, “and you want to make yourself a cup of coffee, please make sure to give the machine only one euro. Not two, or five––one! Why? Because––and please excuse my French––the machine is a whore. It will take your change and not give it back. So if you want coffee before you walk, feed it only one euro please. Unless you like losing your money.”</p>

<p>Laughter.</p>

<p>“One more thing. Listen. You will get blisters. You will have days when you want to cry, give up, and go home. Don’t. The Camino is truly a magical place. It will provide and care for you. It will give you everything you need––but not always everything you want, eh? There’s a difference. Trust it. Listen to it. Have faith in it. Let it guide you. Surrender to the way.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“Ok. So who’s first?”</p>
