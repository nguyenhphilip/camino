<blockquote>
<h3 id="a-poem">A Poem</h3>

<p>Through the window I see <br>
Sun-bathed flowers and untouched rock,<br>
Blades of grass and untrodden walks,<br>
Endless possibility.</p>

<p>I ask of you Time<br>
To yield your determined hand<br>
So I may dance forever with<br>
Infinity.<br></p>

<p><em>–09.09.17</em></p>

<p>I ran into Matilde and Franca while departing from Roncesvalles. They were headed in the opposite direction, back toward the albergue.</p>

<p><em>“Phiiiiilll! Hey we’re gonna make some tea! Would you like to join us?”</em></p>

<p>I hesitated because I was determined to walk the Camino alone –this is my journey. I am here to discover my inner voice&hellip; yah-dah-yah-dah-yah-dah. The words of a wise hospitalero echoed in my mind:The Camino will give you everything you need. Surrender to the Way. Be open to what comes your way, he said. Say yes to life.</p>

<h2 id="center-center"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>We went back inside and started making the tea. Matilde and Franca fiddled with the stove while I stood in a corner and provided moral support. Unfortunately the stove proved to be too complicated. I tried to troubleshoot the problem while the Germans waited in the other room. Having failed, I went to find Matilde and Franca and discovered them chatting with a young Belgian near the vending machines in the kitchen.</p>

<p>I introduced myself and joined the conversation. The Belgian&rsquo;s name was M. She seemed excited about the fact that we were young and spoke fluent English, unlike many of the other pilgrims. Some minutes later, Franca and Matilde went back into the kitchen, leaving M and I to ourselves.</p>

<p>M was in her 2nd year of medical school. She came to the Camino seeking balance, answers. It was her 3rd one, though she had never walked its entire length. I was captivated by her acute self-awareness, her razor-sharp attentiveness, her round, curious, hazel eyes.</p>

<h2 id="center-center-1"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>The day was gray and rainy, a complete contrast to the sun-painted stroll of the prior. We decided it would be a good idea to walk together.</p>

<p>I walked with M while Matilde and Franca trotted together a few meters ahead of us. M was wearing a clear, plastic trash-bag she claimed to be a poncho. That&rsquo;s not a poncho, that&rsquo;s a trash bag; it took her awhile to warm up to my humor. Once we moved beyond the formalities, we began to talk about every imaginable topic that a human-being like me loves: psychology, philosophy, purpose, meaning, meditation, freewill, learning, being. We then exchanged the intellectual brevity for emotional depth: we talked about pain and love, about ourselves and our place in the world. We got vulnerable.</p>

<p>I realized that I, without a doubt, was growing attracted to her. I tried to brush it off because I didn’t want to feel this way – that’s not why I am here. Yet my mind reminded me to Surrender to the Way. The Camino will give you everything you need. But was this something I needed?</p>

<p>As we walked on, I grew increasingly aware of the beauty around us: the colors, the smells, the rhythm of my footsteps, the movement of leaves. My senses were heightened, and I felt incredibly alive. M too was clearly captivated –– by the droplets of water hanging from the leaves, by the dewy smell of the moist air, by the simple joy of feeling free. We moved in constant awe and admiration throughout the day. And before we were aware of it, we were in Zubiri.</p>

<h2 id="center-center-2"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>The single shower in our albergue was occupied. Matilde and M inform me that there is a shared shower room in the other building. Since we had arrived later in the day, I went, believing that it would be unoccupied by other pilgrims. As I made my way toward the other building, I saw another young pilgrim walking toward it too, with clean clothes and a small bottle of shampoo in hand.</p>

<p>Oh boy. I’m going to have to shower with another dude. Wait, there must be stalls. Yeah, it’s all good.</p>

<p>There were no stalls. Only a long aisle with a single curtain covering a row of shower-heads.</p>

<p>We went inside. He acknowledged me with a quick head-nod, and I nodded back. We stepped into the aisle. I turned my back to him and began taking off my clothes; he did the same, I think. I took a corner while he, the other. And then we were showering, no more than six meters apart. I took my time, hoping that he would finish before me. He must’ve had the same thought, because we both stood there for several minutes, showering, in silence. Finally, I made the first move and stepped out of the shower. He continued. I dried myself off, put my clothes on, and scurried out from the building. I reported my experience to the girls, and they were hysterical.</p>

<p>I saw him again later, and we gave each other a quick nod of acknowledgement.</p>

<h2 id="center-center-3"><center>&hellip;</center></h2>

<p>“A man on the Camino told me he was walking because he wanted to find peace: peace with himself. Peace with nature. Peace with God.” –M</p>

<p>The girls and I went to get a drink at the local bar. There we ran into Stefan, the tall, lanky, 18-year-old Texan. He had been drinking since 2pm and was clearly inebriated. We ate pizza and bantered about our respective home countries. It was a good time.</p>

<p>M left early from the bar to have some alone time, and I went and did the same. Back in the albergue, I reflected on the day and wrote. Later, I went into the kitchen and saw M in the corner, writing as well.</p>

<p>I talked to a woman in her 60&rsquo;s from the States. We exchanged some stories, she about her career and children, I about my recent adventures and my worries for the future.</p>

<p>She reassured me, “It&rsquo;ll work itself out, so don’t worry so much. Hell, I’m still learning how not to.”</p>

<p>I never grew tired of retelling my stories to different people. Each retelling refined or redefined the meaning I derived from my experiences. I thanked the woman for listening and sharing her own stories.</p>

<p>Franca and Matilde returned from the bar, and we went to M&rsquo;s table. Later, we enjoyed a community dinner with the other pilgrims and went to bed.</p>
