I arrived in Belgium late in the afternoon. The weather was exceptional: half-clouded skies with no reservation of sunlight, a perfect balance of cool and warm. I exited from the train station and hoisted myself against a tall statue, eagerly looking for my squirrelly Belgium. 15 minutes had passed before I noticed her standing only 20 meters behind me, clothed in a hoodie and a black leather jacket, gray faded jeans and the tall boots of an amazon. Upon realizing who it was looking at her, we sprinted at one another and embraced as someone had come home from war. It felt good to hold her again. Her radiating eyes still had the ability to arrest me.

We caught up over coffee at a nearby restaurant. She talked about the difficulties of returning home, the growing tension between her and her parents, and the continued struggle of trying to find balance within her medical studies. I told her about the rest of my time on the Camino – the magical moments, the people I met, reaching Santiago, the decision not to go further, saying goodbye. It was surreal, the fact that I was in Belgium, staying with someone I had met on the Camino, with M.

I was still confused about my feelings toward her. I believed I was in love, but something about it just didn’t feel right. Was it because we had met on the Camino? Would it have been too good to be true? Or did I simply get the vibe that she didn’t love me back in the way I wanted her to? I was dancing on a thin wire, unsure of when I would fall.

Later, we went to a park and continued our conversation. The topic transitioned to love when she mentioned that S had sent her a firey, passionate email admitting that he had fallen in love with her the moment they met. She was confused and a bit bewildered by the letter.

We often wondered why he was walking the Camino, a question which he always deflected or never gave a straight answer to. Maybe he wasn't ready to tell us why he was walking.

For awhile, we brainstormed ideas of what his motivations were for walking the Camino. Maybe he was a lost-soul searching for love; maybe he was just a normal guy struggling in life like everyone else. Maybe he did something unforgivable back in his home country. Whatever the case, the Camino had a way of connecting people despite the mysteries – or perhaps because of them. On the Camino, the past wasn't as important as the fact that we were there, walking together, sharing our common humanity, sharing a love of the road.

Eventually, our conversation transpired toward the topic of us – me and her – and she mentioned something I will never forget: “You know, back on the Camino, I could have fallen in love with you. We became so close so fast, and it scared me a little. But the reason I didn’t was that it would have changed the reasons for why we were there.” It was strange to talk so openly about us like this, but I replied that I understood and had felt the same way. Though, a different dialogue was occurring in my head: Yes, love does change people, but that’s precisely what makes it so beautiful. Wasn’t the Camino about embracing all that comes your way? We dropped the topic and went to get dinner and ice cream.

We’re in her room, listening to Leonard Cohen. The question still lingers: do I love her? Does she love me? I won’t know until we talk about it. I won’t know until it's out in the open. I’m afraid. What if I jeopardize what we already have? No, we’re different. We can talk about anything and everything.



My gut. A block of lead hanging from it. Something beating faster and faster.It wants to hide. To run. To fly. To breathe. Vessels contract. A river flows. Again. Again. Again.

I am brittle glass, a thin sheet of paper on the eve of some forlorn Christmas. In the distance, a gust with the power to break trees, and men. It kindles a fire that resembles courage.

I turn toward M. She looks straight through me. Inaudible words enter the air. Time collapses.

“I'm in love with you.”

Silence.

Emptiness.

A messy knot of shoestrings.

A moment between moments.

“Phil, I have never met anyone like you before.

What we have, I have never had it with anyone.

You are so special to me.

Please understand that this is the greatest compliment I can give: 

I wish I could fall in love with you.

You are such a pure person.

Your love has no bounds.

Your love is so pure.

You––”

A tiny piece of glass is shattering into a thousand tinier pieces. Time sweeps them into the pan of reality. A naked thread remains.

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now.
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
is fastening my ankle to a stone.

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.

She does not.

I feel numb the next day, but put on my front. M and I go to an African church service. We sing and listen to a genial man preach about love, forgiveness, redemption. I hear nothing. What the hell do you know about love? We eat, drink, chat, and walk around. Things go as planned. Then we’re in the train station. A young, affectionate couple is sitting near us. They're utterly unavoidable, grossly enmeshed and atop one another. Time halts once again.

Anger. Sadness. Disappointment.

I can't be angry, sad, disappointed.

No, to be in love, to have fallen in love, to have been heartbroken, that, in a way, is a gift, despite the pain I currently feel.

Am I rationalizing my pain? I don’t know. I do know though that this will pass. I have never felt more alive.

I guess this is it then.

We embrace one last time and say goodbye. I board the train and look at her through the opaque window. She looks back. I wave and turn inwards. A tear rolls down my cheek. The ineffable fills me. I close my eyes.

An engine whirs to life, and slowly, slowly, I am taken by the arms of an unknown future. Somewhere in the world, the sun is shining.

### My Final Letter: October 15th, 2017

>I have to say that, as I sit here in the airport, I am feeling heartbroken. It's not your fault; it's no ones. It's simply the nature of love. Initially, I felt numb because I was denying the fact that I was in love. It was one of the purest truths I have ever fought, because I didn't want to get hurt; I didn't want to jeopardize our friendship; I didn't want to accept that maybe it just wasn't right. And maybe all of my fears and insecurities are false, and the reason for why I feel what I do now is completely different. I may never know why, but it really doesn't matter – it wasn't meant to be. So I have to accept it – I will accept it. And in the process, I am letting the soft animal of my body feel what it feels, and love what it loves (Mary Oliver is on my mind as I write this to you).

>And I will get back up stronger, more able to give love, more able to receive it, every day from this point on. I don't think we ever know when we are ready for love, but that should not stop us from trying. Because that is what the truest form of love is. That is the only way we know it's real. By trying. By loving. By getting hurt, and, if you’re one of the lucky ones, doing it all over again – maybe with a little less hurt each time. Maybe.

>M, know that you are so special, so able to receive, and give love. Don't ever let anyone else tell you otherwise, including, especially, You.

>I remember the day when you told me that you had never felt love before. That was on day 4 of our Camino. I then made a promise to myself to show you how it feels. I don’t know if I have been successful. But what I believe is, what we had, that was love. It’s possible. It’s real. Hang onto it. Carry it with you. Give it to someone else who will love you back.

>Please don't blame yourself for the way I currently feel – I’ll be fine. I tell you this because you have been my best friend, you have taught me so much about life. Truly, I cannot fathom the depth of our relationship, and I cannot begin to express how thankful I am. I am tearing up as I write this, out of such joy and gratitude. This letter, I suppose, will mark the end of my Camino. It has taught me the final lesson I needed to learn. Love.
