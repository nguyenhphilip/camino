In the morning we walked to Pamplona, our first city. I ran into Maria and chatted with her for a brief moment before running off with the girls to get breakfast. I didn’t know it then, but that would be my final conversation with her. One thing the Camino teaches you, by nature of necessity, is how to let go. Of people, places, your past.

We stopped at a small bakery near the entrance of the city. The bakers were friendly, the chocolate pastries delectable.

This was the first day I distanced myself from the group. At our usual lunch time, I decided to continue walking. I felt the need to recenter myself, to have some alone time. I told the girls and they understood – they even encouraged it – and I walked on.

The landscape opened, and I could see for miles on end in every direction. Small farms and grainy fields, naked mountains and green hilltops decorated the distance. As I walked into the vastness, I felt a growing sense of calm, a clarity of mind, and a strengthening of body and soul.

I arrived at our destination, Zariquiegui, much sooner than expected. M arrived shortly after as did Matilde and Franca, and we checked into an albergue in the back of a small bar. We reconvened outside and chatted over drinks – I with red wine, M with her milk, and Franca and Matilde with their beers. Afterwards, we split up and explored town on our own. I went to the top of a hill, wrote, and meditated.

On my way back down, I noticed that M was sitting on a curb listening to music. I went over and asked if I could join. She said the music she listened to was unusual and “not fit for [my] American ears”. She eventually conceded and gave me her right earbud. I enjoyed the melodies but didn't understand a single word – it was all in French.

After dinner, we went up a hill at the edge of town and laid in the grass for awhile, gazing at stars, telling stupid jokes, enjoying our newfound friendships. In the distance, tiny orbs of light were giving shape and life to the unknown.

It was a moment I didn’t want to end. We were all high on life, drinking from the cusp of time and infinity, somewhere in the depths of a beautiful and wonderfully dark universe.
